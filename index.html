    <h1> History of The Computers</h1>
    <ul>
         <b><li>First Generation Computers (1940s – 1950s)</li></b>
<p>First electronic computers used vacuum tubes, and they were huge and complex.
     The first general purpose electronic computer was the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer).
      It was digital, although it didn’t operate with binary code, and was reprogrammable to solve a complete range of computing problems.
       It was programmed using plugboards and switches, supporting input from an IBM card reader, and output to an IBM card punch.
        It took up 167 square meters, weighed 27 tons, and consuming 150 kilowatts of power. It used thousands of vacuum tubes, crystal diodes, relays, resistors, and capacitors.
The first non-general purpose computer was ABC (Atanasoff–Berry Computer), and other similar computers of this era included german Z3, ten British Colossus computers, LEO, Harvard Mark I, and UNIVAC.</p>

<p>Before the age of electronics, the closest thing to a computer was the abacus, although, strictly speaking,
     the abacus is actually a calculator since it requires a human operator. Computers, on the other hand, 
     perform calculations automatically by following a series of built-in commands called software.
In the 20th century, breakthroughs in technology allowed for the ever-evolving computing machines that we now depend upon so totally, we practically never give them a second thought. 
But even prior to the advent of microprocessors and supercomputers, there were certain notable scientists and inventors who helped lay the groundwork for the technology
 that's since drastically reshaped every facet of modern life.</p>

         <b><li>Second Generation Computers (1955 – 1960)s</li></b>
        
<p>The second generation of computers came about thanks to the invention of the transistor, which then started replacing vacuum tubes in computer design.
     Transistor computers consumed far less power, produced far less heat, and were much smaller compared to the first generation, albeit still big by today’s standards.
The first transistor computer was created at the University of Manchester in 1953. 
The most popular of transistor computers was IBM 1401. IBM also created the first disk drive in 1956, the IBM 350 RAMAC</p>

<p>Second generation computers can be characterized largely by their use of transistors.  
    They replaced the job of vacuum tubes through the 1950s and 1960s. 
     Vacuum tubes generated too much heat, were very large, and proved to be unreliable. Ultimately, they served as an update for using less power and space.
      It acted as a transmitter and resistor (ergo its name; ‘trans’, ‘istor').  Its inventors were scientists at the Bell Telephone Laboratories in New Jersey.
       John Bardeen, William Shockley, and Walter Brattain wanted to make a more efficient and useful amplifier, and in 1952, a transistor was first put to use as a Sonotone hearing
        aid. Computers of this generation essentially used magnetic cores for primary storage and magnetic disks/ tape for secondary memory.

         <li><b>Third Generation Computers (1960s)</b></li>


<p>The invention of the integrated circuits (ICs), also known as microchips, paved the way for computers as we know them today.
     Making circuits out of single pieces of silicon, which is a semiconductor, allowed them to be much smaller and more practical to produce.
      This also started the ongoing process of integrating an ever larger number of transistors onto a single microchip. During the sixties microchips started making their way into computers, but the process was gradual, and second generation of computers still held on.
First appeared minicomputers, first of which were still based on non-microchip transistors,
 and later versions of which were hybrids, being based on both transistors and microchips, such as IBM’s System/360. 
 They were much smaller, and cheaper than first and second generation of computers, also known as mainframes.
  Minicomputers can be seen as a bridge between mainframes and microcomputers, which came later as the proliferation of microchips in computers grew.</p>

<p>The period of third generation was from 1965-1971. 
    The computers of third generation used Integrated Circuits (ICs) in place of transistors.
     A single IC has many transistors, resistors, and capacitors along with the associated circuitry.
The IC was invented by Jack Kilby. This development made computers smaller in size, reliable, and efficient.
 In this generation remote processing, time-sharing, multiprogramming operating system were used.
  High-level languages (FORTRAN-II TO IV, COBOL, PASCAL PL/1, BASIC, ALGOL-68 etc.) were used during this generation.</p>

         <li><b>Fourth Generation Computers (1971 – present)</b></li>


<p>First microchips-based central processing units consisted of multiple microchips for different CPU components. 
    The drive for ever greater integration and miniaturization led towards single-chip CPUs, where all of the necessary CPU components were put onto a single microchip, 
    called a microprocessor. The first single-chip CPU, or a microprocessor, was Intel 4004.
The advent of the microprocessor spawned the evolution of the microcomputers, 
the kind that would eventually become personal computers that we are familiar with today.</p>
